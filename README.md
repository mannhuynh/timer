- Event listener to watch for a click on "start" button
- Draw a full border around the timer
- Start counting down the timer
- Each time the timer counts down, update the border
- Each time the timer counts down, update the text
- If we counted  down and timer reaches 0 -> reset the border
- Reset internal timer to get ready for another run.
